# Social Media Project
this application was built to handle all of the social media needs of a company.
the application is built in DDD methodology.
the dockerfile and Nginx conf to run the project are available in the project root.

# Technical Choices
the reason this app is built on FastAPI was the fact that it is fast to build the MVP and it's as scalable as it gets.
mongoDB is chosen as database because there is gonna be a lot database relations in the feutue and we don't our app to slow down becuase of using a relational SQL so we use the best available noSQL which is mongoDB.

# Trade-off
this project was built without any tests and both integrated and unit tests are expected to be added to the project before sending project to production.
most of exception handling system is not done yet due to time limitations and this is also required in the project for feuture.
some enpoints might share other users data with someone who doesn't own the data and it's planned to be fixed in fruture.

# Host
this project is not hosted anywhere in this time
